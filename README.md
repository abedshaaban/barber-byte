### Barber Byte is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo). Turborepo is a
  high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.
- For the frontend, the web app uses the [Next.JS app router](https://nextjs.org/).
  Next.js is a React framework that supports server-side rendering.
- For the backend, [Laravel API](https://laravel.com/) is used. Leveraging the MVC model,
  Laravel ensures app security through well-structured routes, middleware, and
  authentication mechanisms.
- The foundation of this project is built upon [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a framework
  for creating desktop applications. Building an optimized, secure, and
  frontend-independent application for multi-platform deployment.
- The app uses [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) as an endpoint to request AI image
  generated haircuts with [DALLÂ·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e) as
  recommended haircuts and showcase for clients.
