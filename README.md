### Barber Byte is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo). Turborepo is a
  high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.
- For the frontend, the web app uses the [Next.JS app router](https://nextjs.org/).
  Next.js is a React framework that supports server-side rendering.
- For the backend, [Laravel API](https://laravel.com/) is used. Leveraging the MVC model,
  Laravel ensures app security through well-structured routes, middleware, and
  authentication mechanisms.
- The foundation of this project is built upon [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a framework
  for creating desktop applications. Building an optimized, secure, and
  frontend-independent application for multi-platform deployment.
- The app uses [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) as an endpoint to request AI image
  generated haircuts with [DALLÂ·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e) as
  recommended haircuts and showcase for clients.

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

### Mastering AI Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering:

- In this project, we leverage advanced prompt engineering techniques to enhance the
  interaction with natural language processing models. We carefully tell these models what
  to do by giving them specific instructions. The snippet below is an example of how we do
  it. By doing this, we make sure these models understand and create exactly what we want,
  making the whole process work smoothly and accurately for different tasks and
  preferences.

```php
$prompt = "film still, portrait of a human, " . $request->prompt . ", salon photography";
```

This piece of code is a small example of how we make sure the computer models create
images exactly as we want them to, tailored to specific instructions and user needs.

### Efficient AI Deployment: Unleashing the Potential with AWS Integration:

- This project leverages AWS deployment strategies to seamlessly integrate and deploy
  natural language processing models. With a focus on scalability, reliability, and
  performance, we ensure that AI applications powered by these models deliver robust and
  responsive solutions for diverse use cases.
